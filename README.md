## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hitesh-mungara/Diabetic-Prediction-Model.git
   cd Diabetic-Prediction-Model
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - **On Unix-based systems (macOS/Linux):**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.
